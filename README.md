# Flask app based on the Fibonacci series

Using Flask (python 3), HTML, CSS and deployed with Heroku!

## How it works

The famous [Fibonacci Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) can be calculated with a recursive algorithm, with some sort of built-in memory (in an attempt of optimizing the time of calculation). With this, we can go as far as calculating the 99999th Fibonacci number.
